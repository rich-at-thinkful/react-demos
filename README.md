# React Router demo code

This code is complete from the Router lecture. It demonstrates:

* Installing `react-router-dom`
* Using the `BrowserRouter`
* Defining individual `<Route>` components, using inexact and exact paths
* Defining named parameters
* Combining learnings of `useEffect` to load data on the render of a top-level route component
